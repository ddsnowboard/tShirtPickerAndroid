#*Specification for Android version of T-Shirt Picker*
This should be a rough equivalent to the PC version, written in Python. The demands of the mobile platform, including the limited screen size, are among the factors that will force me to do things rather differently than I did on the PC. I really don't know, for example, how I'm going to show the list of shirts to the user. First, however, will be to set up the less-UI related functions that make the program actually run. I will make a UI for testing, but that won't be the main focus, and as such, the testing UI will not be ideal for everyday use. Once I get the underlying functions done, then I will improve the UI. Then, after that, I will set up an online backup/sync system, if possible. If there is something that I can run free through Google, that will be idea, but if not, then I will try to build my own, though that might not go well.
